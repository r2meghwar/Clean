-- Students' regulation of Eotvos Lorand University (ELTE Regulations Vol. II. 74/C.)
-- states that as long as a student presents another student’s work -
-- or at least the significant part of it - as his/her own performance,
-- it will count as a disciplinary fault.

-- The most serious consequence of a disciplinary fault can be dismissal
-- of the student from the University.

//// Disarium number
/*1.
Given a positive integer number, check if the given number
is a Disarium number or not.
A Disarium number is a number defined by the following:
Sum of its digits powered with their respective position
is equal to the original number.
Example: 135 is a Disarium number, 1^1+3^2+5^3 = 135.

//// Harshad numbers
/*2.
Given a list of positive integer numbers, return a list that
contains the Harshad numbers of the list.
A Harshad number is an integer that is divisible by the sum of
its digits when written in that base.
Examples:
200 True, the sum of digits is 2+0+0=2 and 200 is divisible by 2.
171 True, the sum of digits is 1+7+1=9 and 171 is divisible by 9.

//// Replacing
/*4.
Given the list and a number K, remove all numbers that are divisible by K

//// Failed-passed students

Given list of tuples and an integer value representing the 'pass_marks',

//// Ciphering

Given a list of characters, extract all the vowels and count them.

Example: let's assume that the vowels' count is 2, then:
'a' + 2 = 'c' ... Here we ciphered 'a' into 'c'
'c' + 2 = 'e' ... We did the same as above
For the input ['m', 'o', 'h', 'i','d','o'] count of vowels is 3 o,i,o.
